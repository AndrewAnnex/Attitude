Statistical motivation
======================

- Error reporting for remotely gathered bedding orientations is difficult
- Many Mars mapping studies report no error ranges, or poorly repeatable
  errors based on unstated assumptions
- Lack of visualization tools makes it difficult to assess relative quality
  of measurements

   (B) A generalization of possible nominal planes to a hyperbolic error space in
       two dimensions.
