# Report

Currently non-functional code to produce a HTML report covering
the main features of the orientation dataset. We have shifted away
from this in favor of pushing more data to the frontend and writing
views with, e.g. `react`. This allows the views to be used in
applications as well.

This code could be updated and re-integrated into the module at a
later date if it seems useful.
